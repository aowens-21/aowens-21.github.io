## DrRacket and Keybindings

We all probably use DrRacket to write Racket, Scribble, Redex, and programs in other languages in the racket ecosystem.
DrRacket's unique position as a development environment for so many different languages comes with an equally unique problem.
Specifically, we'd like it to be an environment that provides support for all the languages we might use in the Racket ecosystem.

In 321 we use `#lang plai` to write interpreters, and to do this we first write out various types using `define-type`, and then write our interpreter's
behavior using `type-case`. It's tedious to write all these `type-case`s from scratch, and proper environment support for the language might include some tool that generates a `type-case`
for a given `define-type`. One way to provide this functionality is through an editor keybinding.

## Adding Keybindings as a Language Author

The onus is on the language author to provide this functionality, not the maintainer of DrRacket, since DrRacket is at its core a Racket IDE. The question becomes: **How do we give language authors access to the editor?**

We could let them write arbitrary Racket code:

This interface might be too powerful, they can do whatever they want to DrRacket or the user's filesystem:

Letting language implementers extend DrRacket with arbitrary Racket code is too flexible, and allows for malicious programs to run as soon as a user opens a program written in their language. What we need is a restricted interface that encapsulates all the things we'd like to make a keybinding do. Maybe we can take the LOP approach and create a keybinding DSL?

## LOP For Extensible Editors

The keybinding language is nice and lets us extend DrRacket along one axis: we can create new functionality via a keybinding that manipulates the buffer in an automated way. By making this a language, we gain the safety that the language guarantees (it's restricted to the domain of the current buffer, programs will terminate, etc...). We can push this pattern further.

There is a more general key idea here: attaching programs to syntax objects that DrRacket can run. By designing more languages that allow langauge authors extend DrRacket in new ways, we can turn DrRacket into a very extensible development environment that supports a full language ecosystem.
